    <h3>Benten Privacy Policy</h3>
    
    <p> The Benten's Privacy Policy describes how Benten treats health information when you use Benten's service, including information provided when you use Benten's mOQOLD site. In addition, the following describes our privacy practices that are specific to mOQOLD, a service that helps you create, manage, store and organize your mOQOLD information. </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>You are in control of your information </b>
            <ol>
                <li>You control who can access your health information stored in mOQOLD. By default, you are the only user who can view and edit your information. If you choose to, you can share your information with other staff members at your facility. </li>
                <li>Benten will not sell, rent, or share your information (identified or de-identified) without your explicit consent, except in the limited situations described in the Benten Privacy Policy, such as when Benten believes it is required to do so by law. </li>
                <li>You can completely delete your information at any time by contacting our support staff. Deletion will be initiated immediately by our support staff, and your information will be purged from your account shortly thereafter. Additional backup copies of deleted information may persist for a short time. Since deleted data will not be restored, you may want to print information before deleting it.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li><b>How Benten uses your information </b>
        <ol>
            <li>To store your information in mOQOLD, you will need a User Account. When you create a User Account, Benten asks for your email address and a password, which is used to protect your account from unauthorized access. You will need an existing email account or create a new email account specifically for this purpose. </li>
            <li>Benten's servers automatically record log information about your use of mOQOLD (such as number of sign-ins and number of times a link was clicked). This information is temporarily stored in association with your User Account for usability studies for 1 year, at which point it is removed from the mOQOLD system and is no longer associated with your account. The log information will be used to operate and improve the service and will not be correlated with your use of mOQOLD services. </li>
            <li>Benten periodically publishes usability statistics and associations. Benten may use data from your MOQOLD account as part of an aggregated data set when publishing these statistics and associations (e.g., Benten has found that certain usability metrics are good indicators of trends in quality of life servcies.. These aggregated data sets do not contain any personally identifiable information. </li>
            <li>Certain features of mOQOLD can be used in conjunction with other Benten products (e.g. REALPREP, I-CAN), and those features may share information to provide a better user experience and to improve the quality of our services. For example, mOQOLD can help you share resident information from your Contact List in event of an emergency.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li><b>Sharing your information with people you trust</b>
        <ol>
        <li>If you share your information with other staff members or people, you can view a list of who has access to your information and you can revoke sharing privileges at any time. When you revoke someone's ability to read your health information, that party will no longer be able to read your information, but may have already seen or may retain a copy of the information. </li>
        <li>mOQOLD contains links to third-party service providers that are capable of sending information to mOQOLD. These service providers (which may include social media services such as Facebook and Twitter) may provide information which extend the functionality of MOQOLD in other ways. By creating a link to these service providers, you give them permission to send you information such as twits, user profile information, or reports to your mOQOLD account. </li>
        <li>You can approve access for some of these service providers to view and copy your health information. If a service provider accesses your health information and stores a copy of your information, that copy will be governed by that service provider's privacy policy. Others at that service provider – like an site administrator – may be able to view your information. Benten is not responsible for the content, performance, or privacy policies of third-party service providers. </li>
        <li>Some of these third-party service providers will be covered by federal and state health privacy laws (such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or "HIPAA"), and those laws will govern how they may use and share your information. HIPAA requires (as does mOQOLD) that you must authorize these providers to send information to your mOQOLD account. With that authorization, you also give them permission to send certain especially sensitive types of health information (such as mental health or substance abuse records) that are protected by federal and state laws and require special authorization. When you ask Benten to send your health information to others, you will also be giving Benten permission to send those sensitive types of health information.</li>
        <li>All entities or business associates covered by HIPAA are contractually required to comply with HIPAA's rules related to collection, use, and sharing of your information.</li>
        </ol>
